# **Introduction**
Design specification:
Design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of an unfamiliar application in a restricted timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
We were given a vet clinic web app with separate front and backend infrastructures. This application was written in a mix of Java and TypeScript. <br/>
<br/>
The goal was to create a CI/CD pipeline. Utilising the tools, systems and principals we had learned up until now.
For this to work the group has utilised the following architecture.<br/>
- IAAS - Terraform to create the AWS ecosystem and Configure the environment of the Virtual machines.
- EKS to orchestrate the containers which will run the applications.
- CI Server - Jenkins functioning as pipeline with Webhooks from the version control GIt Hub, to trigger builds.<br/>
Through this presentation we hope to demonstrate;
- A working knowledge of tools including terraform and kubernetes
- The ability to work effectively on the GCP plactform
- The use of Agile and DevOps principles
- The ability to work as a self-managed autonomous team
- An understanding of the importance and use of conventions<br/>
<br/>

## **Project Planning** <br/>
We used a trello board
